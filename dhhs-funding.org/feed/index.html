<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is the U.S. government&#8217;s principal agency for protecting the health of all Americans and providing essential human services, especially for those who are least able to help themselves. The mission of HHS is to enhance the health and well-being of Americans by providing for effective health and human services and by fostering sound, sustained advances in the sciences underlying medicine, public health, and social services.</p>



<h2>Grant Program Highlights</h2>



<h3>Administration for Children &amp; Families</h3>



<p>The Administration for Children &amp; Families (ACF) promotes the economic and social well-being of families, children, individuals and communities. ACF programs aim to empower families and individuals to increase their economic independence and productivity; encourage strong, healthy, supportive communities that have a positive impact on quality of life and the development of children; create partnerships with front-line service providers, states, localities and tribal communities to identify and implement solutions that transcend traditional program boundaries; improve access to services through planning, reform and integration; and address the needs, strengths and abilities of vulnerable populations including people with developmental disabilities, refugees and migrants.</p>



<h3>DHH Program Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality</h3>



<p>The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality&#8217;s (AHRQ&#8217;s) mission is to produce evidence to make health care safer, higher quality, more accessible, equitable, and affordable, and to work within HHS and with other partners to make sure that the evidence is understood and used. Grants from AHRQ support research to improve the quality, effectiveness, accessibility, and cost effectiveness of health care.</p>



<h4><strong>Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</strong></h4>



<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#8217;s (CDC&#8217;s) Procurement and Grants Office (PGO) awards over 25,000 acquisition and assistance actions each year and obligates approximately $11 billion in federal funds. PGO aids in achieving CDC&#8217;s mission by quickly and effectively allocating funds to where they are needed.</p>



<p><strong>Food and Drug Administration</strong></p>



<p>Each year, the Food and Drug Administration&#8217;s (FDA&#8217;s) Office of Partnerships (formerly Division of Federal-State Relations) sponsors several competitive grant/cooperative agreement programs related to food and feed safety and human health issues. These grants/cooperative agreements provide federal-state agencies with the opportunity to enhance or develop new and existing programs intended to aid in safeguarding products intended for human or animal use.</p>



<h4><strong>National Institutes of Health</strong></h4>



<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) provides financial support in the form of grants, cooperative agreements, and contracts. This assistance supports the advancement of the NIH mission of enhancing health, extending healthy life, and reducing the burdens of illness and disability. While NIH awards many grants specifically for research, we also provide grant opportunities that support research-related activities, including: fellowship and training, career development, scientific conferences, resource and construction.</p>
